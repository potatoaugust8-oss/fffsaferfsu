<h2>Protecting Students, Preserving Privacy</h2>
<p>Florida State University (FSU) is a vibrant and diverse academic community. Every day, thousands of students and staff rely on access systems to enter dorms, computer labs, and recreational spaces. Yet our traditional ID card systems are increasingly outdated: cards can be lost, stolen, or borrowed, and PIN numbers are often shared or forgotten. This approach confirms possession, not identity.</p>
<p><b>Safer FSU: Biometrics Done Right</b> proposes a forward-looking alternative—a <b>privacy-preserving biometric access system</b> designed to strengthen safety while protecting individual rights. Using encrypted biometric templates—numerical representations of fingerprints or faces rather than photos—the system provides faster and fairer access without compromising privacy.</p>
<p>Our vision is clear: a safer, smoother campus experience that never sacrifices trust or transparency. By integrating ethical design and strong oversight, FSU can set an example of innovation guided by responsibility.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Faster and more reliable than ID cards</li>
  <li>Reduces the risk of lost, borrowed, or cloned credentials</li>
  <li>Saves time for both students and faculty</li>
  <li>Respects student privacy through encryption and consent</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="why">
<h2>Why Biometrics?</h2>
<p>Biometric authentication identifies a person directly rather than verifying what they carry. It ensures that access is personal, immediate, and secure. Instead of requiring a card or code, students can verify identity using a fingerprint or face template that is securely encrypted. Importantly, the system does not store or transmit images—it only uses mathematical representations that cannot be reversed to reconstruct a person’s appearance.</p>
<p>The existing card-based systems fail to meet modern security needs. Lost or shared cards allow unauthorized access, while forgotten PINs create inconvenience. Biometrics eliminate these weaknesses while maintaining fairness and inclusivity.</p>
<h3>Myths vs. Facts</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Myth:</b> Biometrics mean surveillance. <br><b>Fact:</b> Verification occurs only at entry—no continuous tracking.</li>
  <li><b>Myth:</b> Enrollment will be mandatory. <br><b>Fact:</b> Participation is voluntary, and non-biometric alternatives remain available.</li>
  <li><b>Myth:</b> If hacked, my face is stolen. <br><b>Fact:</b> Templates are encrypted and non-reversible.</li>
</ul>
<p>When understood correctly, biometrics are not a threat—they are an opportunity to balance convenience and accountability.</p>

<section id="privacy">
<h2>Privacy & Ethics</h2>
<p>At the heart of Safer FSU lies an ethical framework: privacy is not optional—it is foundational. Every design decision is made with the student’s rights in mind, from data encryption to deletion timelines.</p>
<h3>1. Data Minimization</h3>
<ul><li>Only essential data are collected: encrypted templates, anonymous IDs, and timestamps.</li>
<li>No personal identifiers are linked with biometric data.</li></ul>
<h3>2. Security Measures</h3>
<ul><li>Encryption in storage and transmission.</li>
<li>Role-based access for administrators.</li>
<li>Independent third-party audits.</li></ul>
<h3>3. Consent and Control</h3>
<ul><li>Participation is opt-in.</li><li>Students may unenroll at any time, with data deleted within 24 hours.</li><li>Clear consent documentation accompanies enrollment.</li></ul>
<h3>4. Transparency and Oversight</h3>
<ul><li>Annual public privacy reports.</li><li>Student–Faculty Oversight Board to review policy and performance.</li><li>Open publication of audit findings.</li></ul>
<h3>5. Fairness and Accessibility</h3>
<ul><li>Bias testing across all demographic groups.</li><li>Alternative verification options for accessibility.</li></ul>
</section>

<section id="plan">
<h2>FSU Rollout Plan</h2>
<p>The implementation follows a cautious, evidence-based approach with three clear phases that allow testing and refinement.</p>
<h3>Phase 1: Pilot (Fall)</h3>
<ul><li>Locations: one residence hall, one computer lab, and the Leach Center.</li>
<li>Participation: 100% voluntary.</li><li>Alternatives: NFC card access available.</li><li>Monthly transparency updates shared with the public.</li></ul>
<h3>Phase 2: Evaluation (Winter)</h3>
<ul><li>Independent audits on privacy, bias, and usability.</li>
<li>Adjust retention and security policies based on feedback.</li>
<li>Testing of on-device verification for added privacy.</li></ul>
<h3>Phase 3: Expansion (Spring)</h3>
<ul><li>Expansion only upon approval by Oversight Board.</li>
<li>Continued opt-in participation and clear transparency.</li></ul>
<p><b>Success Metrics:</b> 40% faster entry, zero unauthorized access, and student trust levels above 85%.<br><b>Rollback Triggers:</b> Any privacy violation or audit failure immediately suspends biometric use.</p>

<p><b>Franklin WuFeng-fw24d</b><br>Florida State University | Advocacy for Ethical Innovation</p>
<p>This website was developed as part of FSU’s “Build a Website” advocacy assignment. It demonstrates how multimodal composition—writing, design, and web structure—can promote ethical innovation in real-world issues. The goal is to persuade through transparency, logic, and empathy, showing how privacy and progress can coexist.</p>
